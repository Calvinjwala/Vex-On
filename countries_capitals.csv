Continent,Country,Capital,InformationAfrica,Algeria,Algiers,"The flag's design is derived from the standard of Emir Abdel Kadir in the 19th century which consisted of two equal vertical bands, green and white, as well as being inspired from the flag of the Algerian Regency from the 16th to the 19th century, which consisted of a white crescent and star on a red background (the same as the modern flag of Turkey; the Algerian Regency was an autonomous vassal of the Ottoman Empire). However, for the most part its history is unclear. It is also believed to be based on a flag created in 1928 by Messali Hadj, a nationalist leader. White, green and red, along with the star and crescent have been used historically in Islamic countries. The white color represents peace; the green represents Islam; the red, the blood of those killed fighting for independence in the Algerian War (1954 to 1962) and the star and crescent represent Islam."Africa,Angola ,Luanda ,"The national flag of Angola came into use at independence on November 11, 1975. It is split horizontally into an upper red half and a lower black half, and features a yellow half-gear crossed with a machete and crowned with a star. Later the explanation was made less party-specific: The red is for the blood spilt by Angolans during their independence struggles, while the black is for the continent of Africa. The symbol in the middle is of a crossed cog wheel (representing workers and industry) and machete (representing the peasantry, agricultural production and the armed struggle) with a gold star. It was adopted during a time when Angola had a Marxist government, and thus was supposed to evoke the image of the hammer and sickle found on the flag of the former Soviet Union, a common symbol of Communism. The flag is most recently described and explained in article 162 of the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Angola (Constitution) of August 25, 1992."Africa,Benin ,Porto-Novo,"The national flag of Benin is a flag consisting of two horizontal yellow and red bands on the fly side and a green vertical band at the hoist. Adopted in 1959 to replace the French Tricolour, it was the flag of the Republic of Dahomey until 1975, when the People's Republic of Benin was established. The new regime renamed the country and changed the flag to a green field with a red star in the canton. This version was utilized until the regime collapsed in 1990, coinciding with the Revolutions of 1989. The new government promptly restored the original pre-1975 flag. The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. Nationally, the yellow and green allude to the northern savannas and palm groves located in the south of the country, while the red symbolizes the blood shed by those who fought for Dahomey. On a continental level, the yellow, green and red represented the Pan-Africanist movement; the three colours were utilized by the African Democratic Rally, a political party representing the interests of French West Africa in the National Assembly of France at the time of decolonization. Furthermore, the colours are the same as the ones utilized in the flag of Ethiopia. This honours the oldest independent country in Africa and the only nation other than Liberia to remain independent during the Scramble for Africa."Africa,Botswana ,Gaborone ,"The flag of Botswana is a flag consisting of a light blue field cut horizontally in the centre by a black stripe with a thin white frame. Adopted in 1966 to replace the Union Jack, it has been the flag of the Republic of Botswana since the country gained independence that year. It is one of the few African flags that utilizes neither the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement nor the colours of the country's leading political party. <br><br>The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The light blue represents water—specifically, in its form of rain, as it is a precious resource in Botswana, which relies on agriculture and suffers from frequent droughts due to the dry and arid climate of the Kalahari Desert. The blue also alludes to the motto featured on the coat of arms of Botswana—Pula, which means ""Let there be rain"" in Setswana—as well as life, which is sustained by water.<br><br> The black band with the white frame has two meanings. Firstly, they symbolize the harmony and cooperation between the people of different races who live in Botswana, as well as the racial diversity of the country. Furthermore, they represent the stripes of the zebra, the national animal of Botswana."Africa,Burkina Faso ,Ouagadougou ,"The flag of Burkina Faso is formed by two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and green, with a yellow five-pointed star resting in the center. The flag was adopted on 4 August 1984. The flag is coloured in the popular Pan-African colours of the Ethiopian flag, reflecting both a break with the country’s colonial past and its unity with other African ex-colonies. The red is also said to symbolize the revolution and the green the abundance of agricultural and natural riches. The yellow star placed over the red and green stripes is the guiding light of the revolution. The flag was adopted following the coup of 1983 which brought Thomas Sankara to power. <br><br> From 1984 until 1997, the official Burkina Faso coat of arms used a revolutionary central crest featuring a mattock crossed with a Soviet AK-47 assault rifle, along with an open book symbolising the importance of education and the study of revolutionary principles. A lower banner declared in French, ""Motherland or Death, We Shall Overcome""."Africa,Burundi ,Bujumbura ,"The national flag of Burundi was adopted on June 28, 1967 after the country's independence from Belgium on 1 July 1962. It consists of a white saltire which divides the field into alternating red and green areas. The center of the saltire merges into a white disk, on which there are three red solid six-pointed stars outlined in green. The ratio of the flag was 2:3 until September 27, 1982. The current ratio is 3:5.<br><br> The map is divided into four parts by a white cross. The upper and lower parts are red in color while the left and right ones are green in color. White color of the cross represents peace, green represents the nation's hopes placed on future development and red symbolizes the suffering of the nation during its freedom struggle. The three stars in triangular configuration stand for the three major ethnic groups of Burundi: the Hutu, the Twa and the Tutsi. The three stars also stand for the three elements of the national motto: Unité, Travail, Progrès (""Unity, Work and Progress""), which can be seen on the Coat of arms of Burundi. They also represent the loyalty that the citizens of the nations have pledged to their God, king and country."Africa,Cameroon ,Yaoundé ,"The national flag of Cameroon was adopted in its present form on 20 May 1975 after Cameroon became a unitary state. It is a vertical tricolor of green, red and yellow, defaced with a five-pointed star in its center. There is a wide variation in the size of the central star, although it is always contained within the inside stripe.<br><br> The color scheme uses the traditional Pan-African colors (Cameroon becoming the second state to do so). The center stripe is thought to stand for unity: red is the colour of unity, and the star is referred to as ""the star of unity"". The yellow stands for the sun, and also the savannas in the northern part of the country, while the green is for the forests in the southern part of Cameroon."Africa,Cape Verde ,Praia ,"The national flag of Cape Verde was adopted on September 22, 1992, replacing the flag adopted during Cape Verdean independence, fought for with Guinea-Bissau, another former Portuguese colony on mainland West Africa.<br><br> The 10 stars on the flag represent the main islands of the nation (a chain of islands off the coast of West Africa). The blue represents the ocean and the sky. The band of white and red represents the road toward the construction of the nation, and the colours stand for peace (white) and effort (red). The yellow colour, circular formation of the stars, and dark blue field show similarity to the flag of Europe with 12 stars instead of 10, originally designed for the Council of Europe, but also used by the European Union. The stripes are in 6:1:1:1:3 ratio, and the circle of stars is centred 3/8 along the fly."Africa,Central African Republic ,Bangui ,"The flag of the Central African Republic was adopted on December 1, 1958. It was designed by Barthélemy Boganda, the first president of the autonomous territory of Oubangui-Chari, who believed that ""France and Africa must march together."" Thus he combined the blue, white and red of the French tricolour and the Pan-African colors red, green and yellow.<br><br> According to its official description, red symbolizes the blood of the people of the nation, the blood that was spilt in order to bring it independence, and the blood that they would spill to protect their nation. Blue represents the sky and freedom. White represents peace, and dignity. Green represents hope, and faith. Yellow represents tolerance."Africa,Chad ,N'Djamena ,xAfrica,Comoros ,Moroni ,xAfrica,Congo ,Brazzaville ,xAfrica,Democratic Republic of Congo ,Kinshasa ,xAfrica,Djibouti ,Djibouti,xAfrica,Egypt ,Cairo ,xAfrica,Equatorial Guinea ,Malabo ,xAfrica,Eritrea ,Asmara ,xAfrica,Ethiopia ,Addis Ababa ,xAfrica,Gabon ,Libreville ,xAfrica,Gambia ,Banjul ,xAfrica,Ghana ,Accra ,xAfrica,Guinea ,Conakry ,xAfrica,Guinea-Bissau ,Bissau ,xAfrica,Ivory Coast ,Yamoussoukro,xAfrica,Kenya ,Nairobi ,xAfrica,Lesotho ,Maseru ,xAfrica,Liberia ,Monrovia ,xAfrica,Libya ,Tripoli ,xAfrica,Madagascar ,Antananarivo ,xAfrica,Malawi ,Lilongwe ,xAfrica,Mali ,Bamako ,xAfrica,Mauritania ,Nouakchott ,xAfrica,Mauritius ,Port Louis ,xAfrica,Morocco ,Rabat ,xAfrica,Mozambique ,Maputo ,xAfrica,Namibia ,Windhoek ,xAfrica,Niger ,Niamey ,xAfrica,Nigeria ,Abuja ,xAfrica,Qatar ,Doha ,xAfrica,Rwanda ,Kigali ,xAfrica,São Tomé and Príncipe ,Sao Tome,xAfrica,Senegal ,Dakar ,xAfrica,Seychelles ,Victoria ,xAfrica,Sierra Leone ,Freetown ,xAfrica,Somalia ,Mogadishu ,xAfrica,South Africa ,Cape Town,xAfrica,South Sudan ,Juba ,xAfrica,Sudan ,Khartoum ,xAfrica,Swaziland ,Mata-utu ,xAfrica,Tanzania ,Dodoma,xAfrica,Togo ,Lomé ,xAfrica,Tunisia ,Tunis ,xAfrica,Uganda ,Kampala ,"The flag of Uganda was adopted on 9 October 1962, the date that Uganda became independent from the United Kingdom. It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. The three colours are representative of African peoples (black), Africa's sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected).<br><br> The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolizes the forward movement of the country. During the colonial rule the Britishers selected the flag of Buganda for using on British Blue ensign. The crane was added in the center to avoid the flag's association with a particular geographic region."Africa,Western Sahara,El Aaiun,xAfrica,Zambia ,Lusaka ,xAfrica,Zimbabwe ,Harare ,xAsia,Afghanistan ,Kabul ,xAsia,Bahrain ,Manama ,xAsia,Bangladesh ,Dhaka ,xAsia,Bhutan ,Thimphu ,xAsia,Brunei ,Bandar Seri Begawan ,xAsia,Cambodia ,Phnom Penh ,xAsia,China,Beijing ,xAsia,East Timor,Dili ,xAsia,India ,New Delhi ,xAsia,Indonesia ,Jakarta ,xAsia,Iran ,Tehran ,xAsia,Iraq ,Baghdad ,xAsia,Israel ,Jerusalem,xAsia,Japan ,Tokyo ,xAsia,Jordan ,Amman ,xAsia,Kazakhstan ,Astana ,xAsia,Kuwait ,Kuwait City ,xAsia,Kyrgyzstan ,Bishkek ,xAsia,Laos ,Vientiane ,xAsia,Lebanon ,Beirut ,xAsia,Malaysia,Kuala Lumpur ,xAsia,Maldives ,Malé ,xAsia,Mongolia ,Ulan Bator ,xAsia,Myanmar ,Naypyidaw ,xAsia,Nepal ,Kathmandu ,xAsia,North Korea ,Pyongyang ,xAsia,Oman ,Muscat ,xAsia,Pakistan ,Islamabad ,xAsia,Palestine ,Ramallah and Gaza,xAsia,Philippines ,Manila ,xAsia,Russia ,Moscow ,xAsia,Saudi Arabia ,Riyadh ,xAsia,Singapore ,Singapore ,xAsia,South Korea ,Seoul ,xAsia,Sri Lanka ,Sri Jayawardenapura-kotte,xAsia,Syria ,Damascus ,xAsia,Taiwan ,Taipei ,xAsia,Tajikistan ,Dushanbe ,xAsia,Thailand ,Bangkok ,xAsia,Turkmenistan ,Ashgabat ,xAsia,United Arab Emirates ,Abu Dhabi ,xAsia,Uzbekistan ,Tashkent ,xAsia,Vietnam ,Hanoi ,xAsia,Yemen ,Sana'a ,xEurope,Albania ,Tirana ,xEurope,Andorra ,Andorra La Vella ,xEurope,Armenia ,Yerevan ,xEurope,Austria ,Vienna ,xEurope,Azerbaijan ,Baku ,xEurope,Belarus ,Minsk ,xEurope,Belgium ,Brussels ,xEurope,Bosnia and Herzegovina ,Sarajevo ,xEurope,Bulgaria ,Sofia ,xEurope,Croatia ,Zagreb ,xEurope,Cyprus ,Nicosia ,xEurope,Czech Republic ,Prague ,xEurope,Denmark ,Copenhagen ,xEurope,Estonia ,Tallinn ,xEurope,Finland ,Helsinki ,xEurope,France ,Paris ,xEurope,Georgia ,Tbilisi ,xEurope,Germany ,Berlin ,xEurope,Greece ,Athens ,xEurope,Hungary ,Budapest ,xEurope,Iceland ,Reykjavík ,xEurope,Ireland ,Dublin ,xEurope,Italy ,Rome ,xEurope,Kosovo,Pristina ,xEurope,Latvia ,Riga ,xEurope,Liechtenstein ,Vaduz ,xEurope,Lithuania ,Vilnius ,xEurope,Luxembourg ,Luxembourg ,xEurope,Macedonia ,Skopje ,xEurope,Malta ,Valletta ,xEurope,Moldova ,Chisinau ,xEurope,Monaco ,Monaco ,xEurope,Montenegro ,Podgorica ,xEurope,Netherlands ,Amsterdam ,xEurope,Norway ,Oslo ,xEurope,Poland ,Warsaw ,xEurope,Portugal ,Lisbon ,xEurope,Romania ,Bucharest ,xEurope,San Marino ,San Marino ,xEurope,Serbia ,Belgrade ,xEurope,Slovakia ,Bratislava ,xEurope,Slovenia ,Ljubljana ,xEurope,Spain,Madrid ,xEurope,Sweden ,Stockholm ,xEurope,Switzerland ,Bern ,xEurope,Turkey ,Ankara ,xEurope,Ukraine ,Kiev ,xEurope,United Kingdom ,London ,xEurope,Vatican City ,Vatican City ,xNorth America,Antigua and Barbuda ,Saint Johns,xNorth America,Bahamas ,Nassau ,xNorth America,Barbados ,Bridgetown ,xNorth America,Belize ,Belmopan ,xNorth America,Canada ,Ottawa ,xNorth America,Costa Rica ,San José ,xNorth America,Cuba ,Havana ,xNorth America,Dominica ,Roseau ,xNorth America,Dominican Republic ,Santo Domingo ,xNorth America,El Salvador ,San Salvador ,xNorth America,Grenada ,St. George's ,xNorth America,Guatemala ,Guatemala City,xNorth America,Haiti ,Port-au-prince ,xNorth America,Honduras ,Tegucigalpa ,xNorth America,Jamaica ,Kingston ,xNorth America,Mexico ,Mexico City ,xNorth America,Nicaragua ,Managua ,xNorth America,Panama ,Panama City ,xNorth America,Saint Kitts and Nevis ,Basseterre ,xNorth America,Saint Lucia ,Castries ,xNorth America,Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ,Kingstown ,xNorth America,Trinidad and Tobago ,Port Of Spain ,xNorth America,United States ,Washington D.C. ,xOceania,Australia ,Canberra ,xOceania,Fiji ,Suva ,xOceania,Kiribati ,Tarawa ,xOceania,Marshall Islands ,Majuro ,xOceania,Micronesia ,Palikir ,xOceania,Nauru ,Yaren,xOceania,New Zealand ,Wellington ,xOceania,Palau ,Ngerulmud ,xOceania,Papua New Guinea ,Port Moresby ,xOceania,Samoa ,Apia ,xOceania,Solomon Islands ,Honiara ,xOceania,Tonga ,Nuku_alofa ,xOceania,Tuvalu ,Funafuti ,xOceania,Vanuatu ,Port Vila ,xSouth America,Argentina ,Buenos Aires ,xSouth America,Bolivia ,Sucre,xSouth America,Brazil ,Brasília ,xSouth America,Chile ,Santiago ,xSouth America,Colombia ,Bogotá ,xSouth America,Ecuador ,Quito ,xSouth America,Guyana ,Georgetown ,xSouth America,Paraguay ,Asunción ,xSouth America,Peru ,Lima ,xSouth America,Suriname ,Paramaribo ,xSouth America,Uruguay ,Montevideo ,xSouth America,Venezuela ,Caracas ,x
